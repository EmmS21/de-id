**Referring Physician:** Dr. Mary Smith

**Radiology Examination:** Chest X-Ray

**Clinical Indication:** Evaluation for potential pneumonia. Patient presented with cough, shortness of breath, and fever.

**Technique:** Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.

**Findings:**
The heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.
There is a focal opacity in the right lower lung field, suggestive of a potential infiltrate. There are no nodules or masses. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. The osseous structures and soft tissues are within normal limits.

**Impression:**
1. Focal opacity in the right lower lung field which may represent a pneumonic infiltrate. Clinical correlation is recommended.
2. No evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
3. Normal heart size and pulmonary vasculature.

**Recommendation:**
Given the clinical history and the radiographic findings, it may be beneficial to follow up with a CT chest for further evaluation of the right lower lung field opacity. Please discuss with the patient and consider ordering as clinically indicated.
